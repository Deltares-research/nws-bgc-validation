# Future developments

- [ ] Add option to plot stratification in the 2D maps, e.g. temperature stratification (top-bottom)
- [ ]	Horizontal binning of transect measurements
- [ ]	Making the unit (DFM / CMEMS) an option in the code
- [ ]	Thinking about oxygen – minimum / mean and which months to use as default? --> more in line with OSPAR Common Procedure. Optimally, observation/model data would be compared at the bottom (within 10 m of the seafloor), in marine waters (i.e. coastal and offshore waters with salinity ≥30), taking the mean during stratification season (July-October), and classified into (<2, 2–4, 4–6 and >6 mg/l) ([OSPAR](https://oap.ospar.org/en/ospar-assessments/intermediate-assessment-2017/pressures-human-activities/eutrophication/dissolved-oxygen/)).

- [ ]	Adding more variables to our code (e.g. pH, Si, temperature, salinity etc) – including defining ‘default’ colourbar ranges for the North Sea, but making this also changeable in a plotting function
- [ ]	Generally writing more functions and cleaning the code to avoid repetitions etc.
