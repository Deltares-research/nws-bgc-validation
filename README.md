# Future developments

- [ ] Add option to plot stratification in the 2D maps, e.g. temperature stratification (top-bottom)
- [ ]	Horizontal binning of transect measurements
- [ ]	Making the unit (DFM / CMEMS) an option in the code
- [ ]	Thinking about oxygen – minimum / mean and which months to use as default? --> follow OSPAR?
- [ ]	Adding more variables to our code (e.g. pH, Si, temperature, salinity etc) – including defining ‘default’ colourbar ranges for the North Sea, but making this also changeable in a plotting function
- [ ]	Generally writing more functions and cleaning the code to avoid repetitions etc.
