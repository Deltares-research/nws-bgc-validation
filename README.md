# Future developments

- [x] Add option to plot stratification in the 2D maps, e.g. temperature stratification (top-bottom)
- [ ]	Horizontal binning of transect measurements
- [ ]	Making the unit (DFM / CMEMS) an option in the code
- [ ]	Thinking about oxygen – minimum / mean and which months to use as default? --> more in line with OSPAR Common Procedure. Optimally, observation/model data would be compared at the bottom (within 10 m of the seafloor), in marine waters (i.e. coastal and offshore waters with salinity ≥30), taking the mean during stratification season (July-October), and classified into (<2, 2–4, 4–6 and >6 mg/l) ([OSPAR](https://oap.ospar.org/en/ospar-assessments/intermediate-assessment-2017/pressures-human-activities/eutrophication/dissolved-oxygen/)).

- [ ]	Adding more variables to our code (e.g. pH, Si, temperature, salinity etc) – including defining ‘default’ colourbar ranges for the North Sea, but making this also changeable in a plotting function
- [ ]	Add difference map functionality: Not just to satellites, but also model-to-model for different variables?
- [ ]	Generally writing more functions and cleaning the code to avoid repetitions etc.
- [ ]	Add extinction data into NWDM: p:\archivedprojects\11203731-wozep\03_prim_sec_production\01_data\extinction\sioene.csv
