# Future developments

[]	Making the unit (DFM / CMEMS) an option in the code
[]	Thinking about oxygen – minimum / mean and which months to use as default?
[]	Adding more variables to our code (e.g. pH, Si, temperature, salinity etc) – including defining ‘default’ colourbar ranges for the North Sea, but making this also changeable in a plotting function
[]	Generally writing more functions and cleaning the code to avoid repetitions etc.
